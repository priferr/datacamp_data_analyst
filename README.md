# Data Engineer Track

This Datacamp course brings hands-on learning path of a solid Data Engineer career.
From the "Introduction to SQL" to "Design a Bank Database", it covers everything a data engineer has to know in terms of language,
logic, thinking, tools and clean code. 
There are 17 courses and 1 bigger project, also testing skills along the way and suggesting new courses based on performance.
In this repo I bring the projects I could work on this learning path.
