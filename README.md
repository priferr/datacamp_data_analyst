# Data Analyst with Python Track

This Datacamp course brings hands-on learning path of a solid Data Analyst career with versatile Python.
From the "Introduction to Python" to "Hypothesis Testing in Python", it covers what a data analyst has to know in terms of data importing, cleaning, manipulating, and visualizing with Python; tools and clean code to start working. 
There are 11 courses and several academic project, also testing skills along the way and suggesting new courses based on performance.
